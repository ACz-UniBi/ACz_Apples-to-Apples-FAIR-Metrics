# Benchmarks for Apples-to-Apples FAIR Signposting


These are the [Apples-to-Apples FAIR Signposting](https://signposting.org/FAIR/apples-hackathon/)
benchmark tests for tools to verify parsing and compliance with the
[FAIR Signposting](https://signposting.org/FAIR/) profile.

Tests named `*-http-*` are meant to be published on a [Apache HTTPd]() server using `.htaccess` to insert the `Link` http headers. These are deployed on <https://w3id.org/a2a-fair-metrics/> using PIDs.

Tests named `*-html-*` can be consumed independently for testing for HTML `<link>` headers.
